## Overview of the analysis
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results 

> The mean temperatures in Oahu is similar in the months of June and December with mean temperatures of 75 F and 71 F, respectively

> The max temperatures are also similar in June and December with upper temperatures reaching 85 F and 83 F, repectively.

> The main difference between the months of June and December is the minimum temperatures reached. June had a minimum temperature of 64 F and December had 56 F.

## Summary

> The mean, minimum, and maxmimum temperatures in Oahu are similar when comparing the temperatures from June and December over multiple years of data. The stable range of temperatures would support the idea that the surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year-round. Two additional queries that could be for comparison would be to query the precipitation and wind during those months.
